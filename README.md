# CFU-counter

## ðŸ“– Introduction

This project aims to automate the process of counting bacteria colonies on agar plates, a fundamental task in microbiology that is traditionally performed manually. Manual counting is slow, tedious, and prone to human error. Our goal is to develop a robust system using deep learning, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), to accurately count the number of Colony Forming Units (CFU) from a digital image.
